What you struggled with and what you learned

I made a program using Godot which takes two matrix inputs (one 2x2 matrix and one 2x1 matrix) and multiplies them together. You can swap out the 2x1 matrix without changing the 2x2 matrix bby pressing redo, and you can also restart the program to completely change the 2x2 matrix.

I made this project since I loved learning about matrices and wanted a program that was aesthetically pleasing but I could use to quickly check my answers. I also wanted to play around with Godot and game design before actually making a large project.

I started my project using python - I coded a small program to carry out the 2x2 x 2x1 matrix calculation. I did this as I'm more familiar with python therefore, copying my python into godot would be a lot easier than trying to make the whole calculation in godot itself. I then used Ibis-Paint X to design the backgrounds, choose my fonts and colour schemes, pretty much everything regarding the design aspect of the program. Then I coded the main program, copying my python code but modifying the functions and variables to be suited to godot. I also had to add a lot of features that weren't in python (e.g. the opening screen and the button mechanics).

I struggled with making sure the matrices could be saved and accessed in the end scene. I was used to pythons 'global variables' so the godot equivalent confused me. I learnt a few methods to do so and decided to go with the command for my project since it made the most sense. I also learnt a lot about how nodes and scenes work, as well as how to organise files in godot to ensure my game was organised. Another area I struggled with was understanding how labels worked - which led me to make a lot of my text straight onto Ibis-Paint X. I've now learnt how labels work and how to customise text within godot itself.
